# Multi-Project Web Title Retrieval

This repository contains four projects aimed at retrieving titles from web pages using different approaches. Each project is implemented using different libraries or methodologies to demonstrate various techniques for fetching web page titles.

## Projects

### 1. PageTitleGetter (RxJS Approach)

Description: This project implements the web title retrieval functionality using the RxJS library. RxJS is a reactive programming library for JavaScript, which allows us to work with asynchronous data streams.

### 2. TitleFinder (Simple Approach)

Description: TitleFinder utilizes a simple approach for fetching web page titles without the use of any external libraries. It demonstrates basic HTTP request handling and DOM parsing techniques.

### 3. WebTitleFetcher (RSVP Approach)

Description: WebTitleFetcher implements web title retrieval using the RSVP library, which provides a promise-based API for managing asynchronous operations. This project demonstrates how to handle asynchronous tasks using promises.

### 4. WebTitleGrabber (Async Approach)

Description: WebTitleGrabber utilizes the async library to fetch web page titles asynchronously. Async is a utility library that provides powerful asynchronous control flow primitives.
